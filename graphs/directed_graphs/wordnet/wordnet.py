class WordNet:
    """
    WordNet is a semantic lexicon for the English language that computational
    linguists and cognitive scientists use extensively.
    
    ### Some definitions:

        - `synset`  : set of synonym(s)
        - `hyponym` : more specific synset 
        - `hypernym`: more general synset 

    ### The WordNet digraph:

        - each vertex `v` is an integer that
        represents a synset;
        
        - each directed edge `v â†’ w` represents
        that `w` is a hypernym of `v`;Any argument to the constructor or an instance method is null
    The input to the constructor does not correspond to a rooted DAG.
    

    ### Corner cases.
    
    Raise an exception in the following situations:

        - Any argument to the constructor or
        an instance method is null;

        - The input to the constructor does not
        correspond to a rooted DAG;

        - Any of the noun arguments in distance()
        or sap() is not a WordNet noun.
